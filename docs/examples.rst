Examples
========

This section provides several real examples on how to profile with PyPRrof.

  *TODO:* Provide real examples. Everything here should also be added to
  a QA L0_ test to lock in the code

Navigate to the lenet example. ::

  $ cd pyprof/examples

Run nsight systems to profile the network. ::

  $ nsys profile -f true -o lenet --export sqlite python lenet.py

Parse the resulting lenet.sqlite database. ::

  $ python -m pyprof.parse lenet.sql > lenet.dict

Run the prof script on the resulting dictionary. ::

  $ python -m pyprof.prof --csv lenet.dict > lenet.csv
