Install from NGC Container
--------------------------

PyProf is available in the PyTorch container on the `NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC) 
<https://ngc.nvidia.com>`_.

Before you can pull a container from the NGC container registry, you
must have Docker and nvidia-docker installed. For DGX users, this is
explained in `Preparing to use NVIDIA Containers Getting Started Guide
<http://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dgx/preparing-containers/index.html>`_.
For users other than DGX, follow the `nvidia-docker installation
documentation <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker>`_ to install
the most recent version of CUDA, Docker, and nvidia-docker.

After performing the above setup, you can pull the PyProf container
using the following command::

  docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:20.12-py3

Replace *20.12* with the version of PyTorch container that you want to pull.
