PyProf - PyTorch Profiling tool
===============================

    **NOTE: Our forward-backward kernel correlation heuristics are not working correctly 
    with PyTorch v1.6. We are working to resolve it. In the mean time, please use Pytorch 
    1.5 or the 20.03 NGC container, which you can retrieve via:** ::

      docker pull http://nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:20.03-py3

    **LATEST RELEASE: You are currently working on the master branch which
    tracks under-development progress towards the next release. The
    latest release of the PyProf is 3.2.0 and is available on branch** `r20.07
    <https://github.com/NVIDIA/PyProf/blob/r20.07>`_.

PyProf is a tool that profiles and analyzes the GPU performance of PyTorch
models. PyProf aggregates kernel performance from `Nsight Systems
<https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems>`_ or `NvProf
<https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-visual-profiler>`_ and provides the 
following additional features:

* Identifies the layer that launched a kernel: e.g. the association of 
  `ComputeOffsetsKernel` with a concrete PyTorch layer or API is not obvious.

* Identifies the tensor dimensions and precision: without knowing the tensor 
  dimensions and precision, it's impossible to reason about whether the actual 
  (silicon) kernel time is close to maximum performance of such a kernel on 
  the GPU. Knowing the tensor dimensions and precision, we can figure out the 
  FLOPs and bandwidth required by a layer, and then determine how close to 
  maximum performance the kernel is for that operation.

* Forward-backward correlation: PyProf determines what the forward pass step 
  is that resulted in the particular weight and data gradients (wgrad, dgrad), 
  which makes it possible to determine the tensor dimensions required by these
  backprop steps to assess their performance.
 
* Determines Tensor Core usage: PyProf can highlight the kernels that use 
  `Tensor Cores <https://developer.nvidia.com/tensor-cores>`_.
 
* Correlate the line in the user's code that launched a particular kernel (program trace).

Contributing
------------

Contributions to PyProf are more than welcome. To
contribute make a pull request and follow the guidelines outlined in
the `Contributing <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ document.

Reporting problems, asking questions
------------------------------------

We appreciate any feedback, questions or bug reporting regarding this
project. When help with code is needed, follow the process outlined in
the Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)
document. Ensure posted examples are:

* minimal – use as little code as possible that still produces the
  same problem

* complete – provide all parts needed to reproduce the problem. Check
  if you can strip external dependency and still show the problem. The
  less time we spend on reproducing problems the more time we have to
  fix it

* verifiable – test the code you're about to provide to make sure it
  reproduces the problem. Remove all other problems that are not
  related to your request/question.
